# Goals for the backend

- Backend refers to the platform and infrastructure that powers this project.
- Develop APIs that can be consumed by the frontends and internal platforms.
- Develop services to fulfill business needs related to this project.
- Use a zero-trust approach to authentication, authorization, access, and data retention.
- Use a microservices approach to cope with the large volume of complexity in the domain space.
- Use AWS to host the backend.
- Use Kubernetes as a platform to develop services.
- Development should be value driven. What delivers value? is a good question to ask.
- Quality is key to ensuring value.
- Following the revolutionary model(Emily Freeman), testability(first among equals), reliability (availability, latency, throughput, fidelity, durability), securability, responsiveness, flexibility, observability, reslilience,  scalability, cost, and speed of development should be kept in mind as the project progresses.
- Services should have an expiration date, when they should be rewritten or sunset.
